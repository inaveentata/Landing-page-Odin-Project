            <p>Kenya is 2 hrs ahead of Nigeria, but it does not mean that Nigeria is slow, or that Kenya is fast. Both countries are working based on their own "Time Zone."</p>
            <p>Someone graduated at the age of 22, yet waited 5 years before securing a good job; and there is another who graduated at 27 and secured employment immediately!</p>
            <p>Someone became CEO at 25 and died at 50 while another became a CEO at 50 and lived to 90 years.</p>
            <p>Everyone works based on their 'Time Zone' People can have things worked out only according to their pace. Work in your “time zone”.</p>
            <p>Your Colleagues, friends, younger ones might "seem" to go ahead of you. Don't envy them, it's their 'Time Zone.'</p>
            <p>You are in yours! Hold on, be strong, and stay true to yourself.</p>
            <p>All things shall work together for your good.</p> 
            <p> You’re not late … you’re very much On time!</p>
